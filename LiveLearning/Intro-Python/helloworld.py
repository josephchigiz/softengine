# !Data Types;

################################## *String Types; #######################################
'''
Strings --> str "" e.g "Nairobi", "Ochego", "ALX", *"1000"* etc.
adding "" to any other type makes it a string
'''
price_string = "1500"
print(type(price_string))



# ! len() function;
'''
The len() function returns the length of a string.
! len(variable_name)
'''
print(len(customer))

# * You can also store the length of a string in a variable;

length_of_customer = len(customer)
print(customer + " has " + str(length_of_customer) + " letters in his name")

# * What if we want a string to be printed in capital letters/ small letters?
'''

'''

# ! Replacing a string/character;
'''
You can also replace a character in a string with another character using the replace() function; 
'''

correct_spelling = customer.replace("ch","p")
print("The correct spelling of my name is " + correct_spelling)


# ! Formatting a  print() statement to make it simpler.
# print(lower_customer + " has " + str(length_of_customer) + " letters in his name")
# *The code above is correct but can get a bit confusing, hence the use of .format() is encouraged;

print("{0} has {1} characters in his name.".format(customer,length_of_customer))

# * Slicing strings;
'''
A string is just a group of characters.(An array)
'''
slice = correct_spelling[1]
slice_full = correct_spelling[:]
slice_out_of_full = correct_spelling[:3]

########################################### *Numeric Types; #################################
'''
There are three numeric types in Python:
i) integers - (int) e.g 5, 67, 890, 2900
ii) float - (float) e.g 5.5, 67.8, 890.0, 2900.0
iii) complex - (complex) e.g 52j, 672j, 890+2j, 2900+2j
'''

########################## *Booleans -> bool - (True/false) ##############################

is_correct_spelling_correct = False
print(type(is_correct_spelling_correct))

wow = 1000000 > 10
print(wow)

# *Sequence Types -> Lists, Tuples, Range; 
# *Mapping Types -> Dict;
# *Set Types -> Set, frozenset;
# *Nonetype

############################## ! Operators; #######################################

##### *Arithmetic Operators; 
'''
    + addition -> is used to add two numbers together
    - subtraction -> is used to subtract two numbers together
    * multiplication -> is used to multiply two numbers together
    / division -> is used to divide two numbers together
    % modulus -> is used to find the remainder of a division
    ** exponentiation -> is used to raise a number to a power
    // floor division -> is used to find the floor of a division
'''

addition = 2 + 2

expon = 3 ** 7
floor = 13 // 2

print(addition)
print(subtraction)
print(multiplication)
print(division)
print(modulus)
print(expon)
print(floor)

#### * Assignment Operators;
'''
    = assignment -> is used to assign a value to a variable
    += addition assignment -> is used to add a value to a variable
    -= subtraction assignment -> is used to subtract a value from a variable
'''
# an example of an assignment operator in use;

age = 21

### * Comparison Operators;
'''
These operators are used to compare two values
They include ==,!=,<,>,<=,>=
'''

### * Logical Operators;
'''
    and -> is used to check if two conditions are true
    or -> is used to check if one of two conditions are true
    not -> is used to check if a condition is false
'''


### * Identity Operators;
'''
    is -> is used to check if two variables are the same
    is not -> is used to check if two variables are not the same
'''


# ! Interactivity

### * Input
'''
input allows the user to input a value, and the value can be stored in a variable;
'''

'''name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name)
age = input("How old are you? ")
slice_name = name[:6]
ask = input("{}, do you know you are {} years old?" .format(slice_name, age))
print("Smart Answer... You, not so smart :(")'''

#!Problems

'''

then use these values to calculate the area of the room in m2.
'''
