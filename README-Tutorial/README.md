# Project Title
The Project title should be able to describe your project in one sentence.  
You can check out this complete [README example](README-example.md)  

## Project Description
Write a clear description of your project. Make sure it is brief but don't compromise on important details.  
This should give the reader a clear understanding of what the project is about and what it aims to achieve.  

> In markdown, to go to the next line, add two spaces at the end of the line and press Enter:  
Line 1  
Line 2 

*The element used above is a quote/blockquote. In markdown its is created by using a `>` greater than sign followed by the quoted text*

## Index
1. [How To Install and Run It](#how-to-install-and-run-it)
2. [How To Use It](#how-to-use-it)
3. [Credits](#credits)   
- *An index section is especially useful when the README file is long, with several different sections.*

## How to Install and Run it 
Instructions on how to install the project and how to run it if necessary.  
Also make sure to state any requirements needed to make the installation successful.

## How to use it
This section of the README is supposed to offer a clear guide on how the project *(app, website etc.)* is to be used.  
Including images and/or videos is **recommended**. This enhances the understanding.  

These images can be inserted using: `![Alt Text](url)`. *Ensure there are no spaces between the exclamation mark and brackets*

Below is an example of an image that links to a blog.

[![A fashion blog](https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/contact.jpg)](https://www.hellofashionblog.com)

> Several html tags and elemnts can be used in markdown too e.g `<img>`

<!-- <a href="https://www.hellofashionblog.com" title="Hello Fashion Blog" ><img src="https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/contact.jpg" width="500" height="200"></a> -->

Normal links to other guides and tutorials can also be included in this section, to help the reader understand even better. 

The format for writing links in markdown is: `[Alt Text](url to webpage)` 

> To create paragraphs in MD, press enter at the end of the line leave one blank line and start the next paragraph after the blank line:  
Paragraph 1  
~~empty line~~  
Paragraph 2

As [Hillary Nyakundi](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) said in his article;
>"There is not one right way to structure a good README. But there is
one very wrong way, and that is to not include a README at all."
