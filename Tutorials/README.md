# README Tutorial📖!
In this tutorial, we learn about writing clear and simple README files while ensuring that all important details are included.<br>

## Why?🤔
Why do we have to write good README(s)? Is it not the **code** that matters?<br>
This is a very valid question, and here is why having a README that is clear, simple and intuitive is important;
- It is the first thing a person sees when they encounter your project *(so it should be brief but detailed.)* 
- It will ensure that your project stands out from many others.*(The project should be good too💯)*
- It will help you focus on the aim of the project and what is needed to achieve this.*Like a road-map🐾*
- It will improve your writing:

With a good README, other coders/devs *( & even non-devs)*, can easily understand your code and your project.<br><br>
Reading your README, would you be able to understand what is going on if the project was not yours? And how easily?<br><br>
A clear README is powerful tool that can work positively for your project, while the opposite of that can be very destructive despite having a good project.
